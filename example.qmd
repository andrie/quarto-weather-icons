## Inserting an icon


You can insert a weather icon using the `wi` shortcode. For example, to insert a sunny icon, you can use the following shortcode:

```md
This is a sunny day {{{< wi wi-day-sunny >}}} icon
```

This is a sunny day {{< wi wi-day-sunny >}} icon

## Available icons

You can use any icon from the [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) project. For example, to insert a cloudy icon, you can use the following shortcode:

```md
This is a cloudy day {{{< wi wi-day-cloudy >}}} icon
```

This is a cloudy day {{< wi wi-day-cloudy >}} icon
